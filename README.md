# RMCombat
This project is a combat manager for the pen and paper role playing game Rolemaster. 
It currently manages attacks but not movement, skill or spell casting.
There are a number of bugs. 
To use the software, you need csv files containing weapon attack tables and critical tables. 
These are not included with the source as they are the intellectual property of the game's owner.
